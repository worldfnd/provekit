# Introduction to ProveKit

**ProveKit** is a zero-knowledge proof toolkit specifically designed for mobile devices and resource-constrained environments. It provides a complete stack for generating, verifying, and recursively composing zero-knowledge proofs with optimal performance on ARM64 architectures.

## What is ProveKit?

ProveKit enables developers to:

- **Compile Noir circuits** into efficient R1CS constraint systems
- **Generate fast proofs** using WHIR-GR1CS with Skyscraper hash functions
- **Recursively verify proofs** in Gnark for proof composition
- **Deploy on mobile devices** with optimized ARM64 assembly implementations

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **Mobile-First Design**
Optimized specifically for ARM64 architectures with hand-tuned assembly implementations for critical operations.

### âš¡ **High Performance**
- Custom field arithmetic using Montgomery reduction
- SIMD-optimized operations with instruction-level parallelism  
- Skyscraper hash function for fast Merkle tree operations
- Memory-efficient constraint system representations

### ðŸ”— **Recursive Proofs**
Seamless integration with Gnark for proof recursion and composition, enabling complex proof systems.

### ðŸ›  **Developer Friendly**
Complete toolchain from Noir circuits to deployed mobile applications with comprehensive examples and documentation.

## Architecture Overview

ProveKit consists of several interconnected components:
